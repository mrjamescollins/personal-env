# steps used to configure a tmux -CC anchor for a bastion or jump host
# these steps work with local permissions and should not be installed as root. Tested on OL 6.11 and Centos 7. These versions are totally out of date.
# make sure to have exceptional authentication protections (2fa, physical keys, etc) in place if you plan on leaving a setup like this in place.
# first download the required tarballs:

yum -y install wget
cd ~
mkdir temp
cd temp/
wget https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/2.7/tmux-2.7.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases/download/release-2.1.8-stable/libevent-2.1.8-stable.tar.gz
wget ftp://ftp.invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.tar.gz

# unpack the source from the tar / gzipped files
# compile the libraries and applications together:

cd ~
mkdir local
mkdir local/bin
cd temp/
tar xvzf tmux-2.7.tar.gz
tar xvzf libevent-2.1.8-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf ncurses.tar.gz
